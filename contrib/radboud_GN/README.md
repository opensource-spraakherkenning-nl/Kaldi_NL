These are models and decoder graphs for daily conversations (GN) created by Emre Yilmaz, CLST, Radboud University, Nijmegen. A decode script is supplied named decode_GN.sh.

They are not meant to be run directly from this directory, install them with ``configure.sh radboud_GN`` and run the linked scripts from the root directory of the repository.
